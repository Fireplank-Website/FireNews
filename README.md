# FireNews
A simple application for getting the latest tech news right in one place.

This is my first real web app that I have done and I learned a lot from it.
It uses React.js, Next.js and Chakra UI.
This was meant more of as a learning project but I hope you can still enjoy it!

## Setup
The website is hosted on https://firenews.vercel.app/
</br>
If you want to build from source then first, clone the repository. Then run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contribution and Feedback
I accept contributions and feedback on the project as It is my first real website so any helpful tips and tricks to improve my webdev game would be highly appriciated.
