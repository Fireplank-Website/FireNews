        <Text>Hello! This is my first ever real web application that I have made.</Text>
        <Text>I made this simple news app using a free API to fetch the latest news.</Text>
        <Text>It&apos;s meant to be a learning project as it is my first one so please don&apos;t be so harsh on me. üôè</Text>
        <Text>I used React with Next.js and Chakra UI as it&apos;s a nightmare doing design with CSS.</Text>
        <Text>This app wouldn&apos;t look nearly as good if not for Chakra so thanks Chakra lol.</Text>
        <Text>I hope you enjoy it!</Text>
